<h1>Welcome to Maui!</h1>
<p>Known as the <em>&quot;Valley Isle,&quot;</em> Maui is dotted with quaint towns, artist communities and local favorites that have been around for generations. </p>
<p>Head to <strong>Wailuku</strong> for pastries from a &quot;mom and pop&quot; bakery, or head to <em>Lahaina</em> for a taste of Maui&#39;s famed farm to table cuisine.</p>
<p> From shimmering beaches and sacred <em>Iao Valley</em> to migrating humpback whales and sunset on <strong>Haleakala,</strong> it&#39;s not surprising Maui was voted the &quot;Best Island&quot; by the readers of Conde Nast Traveler for 19 years.</p>
<h3>Haleakala Sunrise and Sunset</h3>
<p>One of Maui&#39;s most memorable experiences is seeing the Haleakala sunrise or sunset from almost 10,000 feet above sea level, and like anything worthwhile, it take some planning. Here are a few tips to make the most of your Haleakala expedition. </p>
<h5>Come Early</h5>
<p>Depending where you get started from on Maui, it can take you up to two hours to drive the Haleakala Highway (HI 37) and then up the winding Haleakala Crater Road leading to the summit of <strong>Haleakala</strong>. It&#39;s an early wake-up call, but the reward is well worth it. </p>
<p>Drive past the Park Visitors Center at 7,000 feet to get to the <em>Haleakala Visitors Center</em> at 9,740 feet. Try to arrive at the <em>Haleakala Visitor Center</em> no later than a half hour before the sun rises &#45; earlier for a good spot. In the summer the sun rises as early as 5:38 AM, in the winter as late as 6:55 AM. The color of the sky and clouds before daybreak are stunning. </p>
